Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
-------------------------------------

The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) is an international collaborative
effort to improve the knowledge about climate change and its impacts on the Earth System and on our society.
`CMIP began in 1995 <https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip>`_, and is currently in its sixth phase (CMIP6).
The CMIP6 data archive consists of data models created across approximately 30
working groups and 1,000 researchers investigating the urgent environmental problem
of climate change, and will provide a wealth of information for the next Assessment Report
(AR6) of the `Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <https://www.ipcc.ch/>`_ (IPCC).
